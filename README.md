Joey's Survey App: This project for my CSC 4026 Secure Cloud Development class is a web based survey app that will eventually allow users to create, share, and see the results of surveys they create. 
The app is developed using replit as an IDE, express as a server framework, jquery and nodejs on the client and server side respectively, and a neon postgreSQL server.
